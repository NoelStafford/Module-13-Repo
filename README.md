# Project Title
Ecommerce Backend Project
## Description

This project involved creating a database and then using seed data to fill the database. After the database had info stored in it the user would be able to manipulate in any way they want by means of create, update, and delete. 

While building this project I learned to:

1. Connect routes to models
2. Create a database and tables inside the database. 
3. Link the database to mySQL
4. Use CRUD on a database 

### Built With

mySQL, Node.js, JavaScript, Sequelize, Express, Insomnia, Postman
